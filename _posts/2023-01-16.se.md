title: "SDTM: SE Subject Element Domain"
---

**Background Story :**

One day, my friend 99 discussed with me if a patient is randomized but not treated has some lab results besides screening, how should we classify the EPOCH variable for him/her in SE domain?
So today we will go over a basic example for SE domain: Subject Element.

**Purpose:**

The SE stores treatment data linked together with demographic data and Trial Design data,  which is possible to standardize and create unique data-driven mapping for a high level view of study.






**SE Mini Sample Data Set: **




Note: The dataset is a dummy sample, real data will have different SESTDTC, SEENDTC dates

To end the story we started, SE would only keep the Screening record for a patient without treatment even he/she has follow up records.

Thanks 99 for sharing a case study with me!

Happy Studying!
