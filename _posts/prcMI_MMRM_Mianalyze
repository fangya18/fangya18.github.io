SAS Multiple Imputation: Proc MI+ MIXED+ MIanalyze
Background Story: Handling missing data presents a significant challenge in clinical trials. Patients are often lost to follow-up or lack of efficacy. Ignoring patients with missing data can be inefficient at best but more often can lead to bias. Common methods such as LOCF(Last Observation Carry Forward), and BOCF(Baseline Observation Carry Forward, Best Observation Carry Forward) are frequently utilized. Today, we will explore a sophisticated technique for addressing missing data: Multiple Imputation.
Note: this simulation is based on MAR : Missing at Random

MAR: if the missingness is independent of the missing values, conditional on the observed variables. Equavlently: if the investigator observes the cause of the missingness, it is missing at random.
Overview:
Proc MI to fill in the missing values with appropriate settings for data characteristics and patterns.
Proc Mixed to fit the MMRM model
Proc Mianlyze to pull the overall estimates and standard errors that incorporate the variability between the imputed datasets.
Plot the MMRM results to show the model comparison

MIanalyze Result4. Model Result Comparison
In examining this dataset, we observe that the results from a direct MMRM analysis on the missing data are strikingly similar to those obtained through Multiple Imputation (Proc MIanalyze). The fully adjusted simulated dataset shows a significant percentage change in results at weeks 12, 14, and 16. This improvement is anticipated as we expect an increase in missing data in the later weeks, primarily due to factors such as lack of efficacy or participant dropout.
Happy Studying!
