Background Story: Recently my friend 77 told me they checked Trial Summary dataset for multiple rounds and fixed many miscellaneous issues.
I wasn't aware of the importance of the Trial Summary dataset until my colleague Jun told me FDA had a meeting emphasized on Trial Summary datasetÂ  on May.21.2021. So today we will go over the basics for Trial Summary dataset. Trial Summary domain presents high-level view and key information from protocol about the trial in a structured format. It provides a complete study picture containing trial phase, protocol title, trial objects, actual and planned arms,
number of subjects, and study start/end dates. It works as a border or outline of a puzzle.


KEY VARIABLES:
TSSEQ: sequence to ensure uniqueness within a dataset, allow multiple recors for the same TSPARMCD.

TSPARMCD: Code limited to 8 letters for ease in programming

TSPARM: Term for Trial Summary parameter

TSVAL: Value of TSPARM
(TSVAL1- TSVALn for additional comments)

*new variables:
TSVALNF : iff TSVAL is null
(mutually exclusive with TSVAL)

TSVALCD : code term in TSVAL

TSVCDREF: Referenc Terminology for TSVALCD 
ex: CDSIC, ISO8601 

TSVCDVER: Version number of the Refence Terminology

Thanks Jun and 77 sharing their TS working experiences.
