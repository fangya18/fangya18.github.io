Title: ADRG Reviewer Guide
tags: [Clinical Trial]
---
Background Story:

One day, my friend 77 asked me which one is more important ADRG (Analysis Data Reviewer's Guide) or define.xml? I think define.xml focuses more on the ADaM dataset level, whereas ADRG provides an overview storyline for the study or additional info besides Define.xml. 

I decided to summarize the general format for the ADRG document.
